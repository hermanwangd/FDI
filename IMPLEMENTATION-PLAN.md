# PKB-001 Implementation Plan

This file defines how currently selected work is delivered. `FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md`
defines what; `BACKLOG.md` records requirement maturity; `STATUS.json` records
the current execution state and next action.

## Current selection

No implementation work is currently selected. A `READY` Backlog item requires
an explicit selection and a new bounded construction plan before execution.

## Verified delivery ledger

| Backlog | Delivered behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `PKB-BL-004` | Deterministic evaluator-only third review of exactly 11 frozen disagreements | Candidate `45b4ba3def00d7b8adfd55153a497788b531a38a`; `validation/pkb001/task7-evaluation/third-review-adjudication-evidence.json`; independent review PASS; Java 731, Python 62, public validation 9/9 |
| `PKB-BL-005` | Machine-verifiable scenario proposal and review lifecycle | Contract and validator tests |
| `PKB-BL-008` | Frozen Graphify capability and live MCP contract | `validation/pkb001/runtime/bl008-stage1-integration-evidence.json` |
| `PKB-BL-018` | Durable structural component identity | Java identity tests |
| `PKB-BL-019` | Immutable realization proposal contract | Java authority and revision tests |
| `PKB-BL-020` | Proposal-only generation and evaluator-gold isolation | Isolation tests |
| `PKB-BL-021` | Hierarchical component comparison | Deterministic comparator tests |
| `PKB-BL-022` | Fail-closed next-run readiness gate | Gate and clean-copy tests |
| `PKB-BL-023` | Evidence-backed scenario proposal generation | Review artifacts and validator tests |
| `PKB-BL-024` | Active review pointers | Control-file tests |
| `PKB-BL-026` | 15/15 repository-owned Python consumers migrated to Java | `validation/pkb001/java-migration/python-framework-inventory.json` |
| `PKB-BL-027` | Portable Graphify runtime and bounded Java stdio-MCP lifecycle | `validation/pkb001/runtime/pkb-bl027-portable-runtime-evidence.json` |

Commit-level history, slice handoffs, test counts, and superseded plans remain in
Git history and immutable evidence; they are not duplicated here.

## Next experiment construction sequence

Before another experiment:

1. Complete the remaining scenario decisions and evaluator disagreement review.
2. Freeze a new scenario-bearing semantics revision.
3. Reconcile scenario-grounded PK-S1 under the Java framework target.
4. Improve Reverse proposal controls and provider-neutral evaluator identity.
5. Define separate scenario, chain, exact-component, and diagnostic metrics.
6. Preregister justified thresholds and approve one exact-revision holdout.
7. Freeze all protocol inputs, regress Petclinic, execute the sealed holdout once.
8. Review the evidence and issue `GO`, `REVISE`, or `STOP`.

The exact current counts, blocker, selected Backlog, and next action are read only
from `STATUS.json`.

## Selection template

Before implementation begins, bind this file and `STATUS.json` to:

- one Backlog ID and normative requirement;
- exact base commit and owned files;
- in-scope and excluded behavior;
- observable acceptance criteria and negative cases;
- focused tests and full regression commands;
- independent review expectations where required.

On completion, replace construction detail with one short ledger row and clear
the active selection. An agent stops with `CONTEXT_CONFLICT` if the five active
files disagree.

## Default verification

Run within the 8 GB system limit:

```bash
MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx2g' ./mvnw clean package -q
python3 -m pytest -q
python3 validation/pkb001/task7-evaluation/public_validate.py .
python3 -m json.tool STATUS.json
git diff --check
```
